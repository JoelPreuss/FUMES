	//I'm basing this part on more recent research: 
	//http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110015862.pdf
	//The paper sumerizes various efforts to capture CO2 from a simulated Martian atmosphere.
	//While Dr. Zubrin and friends are cited, it's Lockheed Martin that shines here.
	//Rapp et al where able to construct a device that froze 80 g/h at it's peak. Their experements predict
	//that capturing CO2 costs 0.871 watt-hour/gram. Given the relative neutraulity of Rapp, I think this will
	//be a good baseline for this part. Let's get their result into more workable units.
	//0.871 w*h/g * 3600 s/h = 3135.6 w/g
	//3135.6 w/g * 1.95 g/L = 6114.4 w/L
	//The best part about Lockheed Martain's work is that I can now arbtraltily pick an output or power cost,
	//and know the other number. There is one problem though: the number I pick here will be the maximum
	//output, while 
	//300 g/5 h * 1 h/3600 s * 1 L/1.95 g = 0.0085470 L
