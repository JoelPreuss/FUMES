		//This part represents a Sabatier reactor, Water Electrolysis, and Reverse Water Gas Shift
		//(S/E-RGWS) ISRU system designed to produce 50 kg of fuel/day, as discribed in 
		//Pioneer Astronautics' paper 
		//"Mars In-Situ Resource Utilization Based on the Reverse Water Gas Shift".
		//This is esetnally Dr. Zubrin continuing his work on Mars ISRU from Martin Merietta
		//(now Lockheed Martin) and estimating system parameters based on his experance.
		//Since KSP is a game/simulation, I'll trust the numbers as writen.

		//Since the whole point of FUMES is to adapt the S/E-RWGS system to stock KSP, I will
		//assume that liquid methane is  LiquidFuel, and liquid oxygen is Oxidizer. The basis for this
		//assumption is that the stock LF/Ox is an abstrcation for various liquid propellants,
		//with optimizations done automatically. Alternatively, it could be a ALL OF THEM in
		//a comic and highly unstable mixture; this would explain the poor proformance and
		//lack of reliability in Kerbal engines. Ether way, I need to ajust the propellant
		//output to match the stock fuel raito (0.9/1.1 LF/Ox). I'll ajust the RWGS reactor
		//output to achive this, since the only input affected would be CO2.

		//Since Dr. Zubrin only gives me a total propelant output, I need to work backwards.
		//His paper on the subject (see above) assumes a O2/CH4 ratio of 3.5 kg/1 kg, as stated on page 4.
		//Since I want to maintain the same methane production rate, I'll find the methane output.
		//50 kg(total) * 1 kg(CH4)/(1 kg(CH4) + 3.5 kg(O2)) = 11.111 kg(CH4)
		
		//As per my assumption above, this means that I need to make 11.111 kg of LiquidFuel per day.
		//The paper assumes fuel production only happens durring daytime, so one day is 12 hours here.
		//11.111 kg/day * 1 day/12 hours * 1 hour/3600 s = 0.00025720 kg/s

		//Community Resource Pack (CRP) gives the desity of LiquidFuel as 1000 kg/m^3, or 1 kg/L.
		//There are five Liters per unit of LiquidFuel though.
		//0.00025720 kg/s * 1 L/kg * 1 LiquidFuel/5 L = 0.000051440 LiquidFuel/s

		//I need to produce 1.1 units of Oxidizer for each 0.9 units of LiquidFuel produced.
		//This is actually well below the minimum output of the Sabatier reactor, as it produces
		//about two grams of oxygen for every gram of methane produced. Since LiquidFuel and Oxidizer
		//have the same density, this means this system will produce propellant in a 1:2 LF/Ox raito.
		//I can have the system dump leftover Oxidizer, so this is not a problem.
		//Reducing the Oxidizer output to stock raitos would be unrealistic and wasteful, as oxygen is 
		//useful for other applications.
		//0.000051440 LiquidFuel/s * 2 Oxidizer/1 LiquidFuel = 0.00010288 Oxidizer/s

		//While the reactors themselves reactors in the S/E-RWGS need gasous hydrogen, 
		//liquid hydrogen is useful for cooling the gasous outputs into liquids. 
		//This would in turn heat the hydrogen into gas, preparing it for the reactors. 
		//Dr. Zubrin assumes this himself, and casually mentions this on page 16 of the paper.

		//So how much liquid hydrogen do I need? I need four moles of hydrogen to make one mole of methane.
		//Everything else is reclamed using water electrolysis. I'm not going to model startup/shutdown.
		//I need to know how many moles of methane the system is making. Methane is 16.042 g/mol.
		//0.00025720 kg/s * 1000 g/kg * 1 mol/16.042 g = 0.016033 mol/s (CH4)
		//0.016033 mol(CH4)/s * 4 (H)/(CH4) = 0.064132 mol/s (H)
		//Hydrogen is 1.0079 g/mol.
		//0.064132 mol/s * 1.0079 g/mol = 0.064639 g/s
		//CRP lists LqdHydrogen's density at 70.85 kg/m3, or 70.85 g/L, at 1 L/unit.
		//0.064639 g/s * 1 L/70.85 g = 0.00091234 L/s

		//I know that the Sabiter reactor consumes one carbon dioxide mole per methane mole, 
		//so I can compute the Sabiter's carbon dioxide consumption from that.
		//Carbon dioxide is 44.010 g/mol.
		//0.016033 mol/s * 44.010 g/mol = 0.70561 g/s 
		//CRP lists carbon dioxide at 1.95 g/L. I'm using gas this time because there's no point in
		//liquidfing something that sublimates before it melts.
		//0.70561 g/s * 1 L/1.95 g = 0.36185 L/s

		//The RWGS reactor is unused in fuel production, since the Sabatier reactor produces 
		//more than enough Oxidizer for stock engines. 
		//It's still included for a little extra challage/fudge factor.

		//There's one more number I need: power consumption. Using the CRP listing of 
		//1 kW = 1 ElectricCharge, I can convert Dr. Zubrin's numbers to KSP terms.
		//Power Breakdown:
		//sorption pumps 	0 kW <not part of this part, see intakes>
		//chemical synthesis 	15 kW
		//controls 		0.08 kW
		//lines, valves, misc 	0 kW
		//refrigerator 		10.5 kW
		//total 		25.58 kW

		//26 kW is very high for stock, especially for a ship on Duna, but not unattainable.
		//It's fair given the numerous advatages FUMES has over stock (mass, size, heat, etc.).
		//That said, Dr. Zubrin did mention in his original perposial for Mars Direct 
		//bringing along a nuclear reactor.
