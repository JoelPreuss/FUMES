				//The reactor system devloped by Martin Merietta in 1994 produced 283 cc/min, which accounted for 93% of all hydrogen used.
				//I'll say the Kerbal verson is 100% effecent, so this would mean that FUMES can produce 304 cc/min (100*283/93).
				//Perhaps unrealistic, but it makes my life easier.
				//So 304 cc/min is 0.304 L/min, which is 0.4634 g/min (0.304/0.656).
				//I'll need to liquidfy it, makeing it dencer. This time I'll use the CRP Density listing, as this next calcuation will give me volume for KSP.
				//0.4634 g/min * 1 kg/1000 g * 1 m^3/425 kg = 0.000001090 m^3/min
				//0.000001090 m^3/min * 1000 L/m^3 = 0.001090 L/min
				//Let's get this in seconds.
				// 0.001090 L/min * 1 min/60 s = 0.00001817 L/s
				//I want to make LiquidFuel, which has a diffentent density and contains 5 Units/Liter.
				//I want FUMES to accurately repersent Mars Direct ISRU, so I won't fudge the numbers.
				//Good news: I can use LquidFuel's density to convert from output mass.
				//1 m^3/1000 kg * 1000 L/m^3 * 0.4634 g/min * 1 kg/1000 g * 1 min/60 s = 0.000007723 L/s
